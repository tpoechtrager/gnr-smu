# Remaining Tasks — GNR-SMU

## Resolved Issues

- [ ] **9800X3D EDC_VALUE confirmation** — `d[64]` is the leading live EDC
  candidate: it directly follows EDC Limit `d[63]`, reads 31 A in the stored
  PBO-configured dump, and historical load samples moved it 44→104 A. The old
  negative result incorrectly required this fast-current reading to exceed TDC.
  Confirm with a controlled EDC-limit change and read-back. See
  [PM_TABLE_MAP.md](../PM_TABLE_MAP.md#edc_value--d64-candidate-revised-2026-08-30).

- [x] **Honesty audit of PM_TABLE_MAP.md (2026-07-30)** — every mechanically checkable claim in the map is now asserted against live hardware by `research/audit_map.py`, which parses the document itself. First run: 51 failures; after fixing the test's own methodology (median instead of mean, paired sampling windows for sensor comparisons) 11 genuine documentation errors remained, all corrected. The worst: three "perfect mirrors with delta < 0.002" that differ on every single read (up to 11.7 W), nine fields labeled "Energy Accumulator (J) / CONFIRMED" that plateau under steady load instead of accumulating, six `Static: Y` flags on fields that move with load, core/thread counts that do not match this SKU, and a "Total floats mapped: 457" claim when 90 indices have no row at all. Full before/after table in [PM_TABLE_MAP.md](../PM_TABLE_MAP.md#honesty-audit-2026-07-30). The audit now exits 0 and is the regression gate for the map.

- [x] **Zone 0x000 mislabeled as temperatures (2026-07-30)** — the "non-linear temperature encoding" theory was a misdiagnosis. Zone `0x000` is the classic Zen `(LIMIT, VALUE)` pair layout: PPT `0x008`/`0x00C` (W), TDC `0x020`/`0x024` (A), THM `0x028`/`0x02C` (°C), EDC limit `0x0FC`. The limits read 162 W / 120 A / 180 A — exactly 9800X3D stock spec, which pins the identification. Consequence: the GUI was showing the thermal limit as "TDC" and the TDC limit (120 A) as "EDC", and pre-filling the MP1 write dialog with those wrong values. Fixed in `tools/gui/gnr_master.py`, `tools/export_telemetry.py`, and `tools/dump_table_full.py` (which has since been rewritten to read its labels from this map rather than keep its own copy). Also corrected: `0x438` is a hotspot temperature, not TDC current; `0x348`/`0x100`/`0x2E8` are percentages, not thermal metrics. Evidence: `research/recheck_zone0.py`, `research/recheck_sweep.py`, `research/recheck_edc.py`.

- [x] **Curve Optimizer (0x50-0x57)** — Validated format: Signed 32-bit int (e.g., -30 = `0xFFFFFFE2`). Successfully integrated into both CLI and GUI.
- [x] **EDC / TDC message IDs — re-opened and settled by measurement (2026-08-26)** — this entry previously read "Validated via fuzzing that on Zen 5, `0x3C` is EDC and `0x3D` is TDC", named no script and recorded no number, and was wrong. It is the reverse: `0x3C` is TDC, `0x3D` is EDC. Both limits are readable in the PM table (`d[8]`, `d[63]`), so the question needed a read-back, not a fuzz: `research/probe_tdc_edc.py` validates the method on PPT first, then finds `0x3D` moves `d[63]` and `0x3C` moves `d[8]`. `research/smu_send.py` had it right all along while the GUI and CLI had it reversed, and nobody noticed the repo contradicted itself. Impact while wrong: the CLI's "reset to stock" wrote 180 A into TDC against a 120 A stock limit, and the EDC menu would accept 250 A of TDC. Found by @tpoechtrager in [PR #1](https://github.com/Kyworn/gnr-smu/pull/1), which assumed the ZenStates order for the 9950X3D and was right to — the disagreement with our profile is what prompted the read-back.
- [x] **Driver Transition** — Replaced the obsolete custom `gnr_smu` driver in favor of the official `ryzen_smu` endpoints (`/sys/kernel/ryzen_smu_drv/`).
- [x] **Frequency Mapping** — Confirmed that PM table offsets `0x514` provide direct GHz floats per core.
- [x] **iGPU Telemetry** — Isolated `0x1AC` (iGPU Power Wattage) and `0x1B0` (iGPU Clock) via Pearson Correlation modeling.

- [x] **Coverage gap closed (2026-07-30)** — the "90 undocumented indices" figure was a parser artifact: 11 rows had five columns and one index range was off by one, hiding 88 indices that were in fact documented. Only 2 were genuinely missing. `research/audit_map.py` now fails if any index has no parseable row.

## Open Research (Low Priority)

- [ ] **IDs 0x58-0x5D** — Identify what these 6 sequential MSG IDs do after the 8 cores' Curve Optimizer arrays.
- [ ] **HSMP** — Explore if the Host System Management Port (HSMP) ACPI interface provides cleaner standard data for power limits than the direct mailbox polling.
- [ ] **Unidentified Floats** — Fully decode the remaining ~180 floats in the `0x724` telemetry block (e.g. C-state residencies).


- [ ] **Demoted offsets — domains narrowed, still unidentified** — thirteen fields are confirmed *not* to be what the map claimed; two profiling passes narrowed them without naming any. Full write-up in [PM_TABLE_MAP.md](../PM_TABLE_MAP.md#demoted-offsets--domains-narrowed-not-identified-2026-07-30). What is left open:
  - **d[16]/d[452] and d[212]/d[453]** — four bounded counters in two opposed pairs (the first drains under load and refills to a hard ceiling, the second does the reverse; anti-correlated down to r = −0.96). Consistent with a consumed/remaining budget pair, but the unit is unknown and no system sensor exposes anything to check it against. Evidence: `research/profile_demoted.py`, `research/transient_demoted.py`.
  - **d[448]/d[449]** — fit load linearly at r² ≈ 0.97, but TDC current, package power, PPT and Tctl are mutually indistinguishable at that level. Needs a load that decouples them.
  - **d[220], d[298]/d[299]** — do not respond to a 120 W → 15 W step at all, which rules out every load-coupled domain. d[298]/d[299]/d[456] are a locked triple off one sensor that is thermally decoupled from the die.
  - **d[17], d[64], d[210], d[278]** — only trend (r² 0.56-0.77); no known axis explains them. d[17] was "Core Power Aggregate (W) / CONFIRMED" and is disproved (exceeds package power at 8 threads, non-monotonic in load). `sum(d[333-340])` is monotonic and the better aggregate candidate, but sums to only ~34 % of package power, so its scope is unverified too.
- [ ] **A load point that varies frequency at constant power** — the blocker for all of the above. Every stressor tried pushes power, current, temperature and utilisation up together, so regression cannot separate them, and response time cannot either: Tctl falls 86 → 52 °C inside one 0.2 s sample, so the die's thermal constant is below the table's update rate. Candidate levers: locked-frequency runs at two different core counts, or a fixed draw at two ambient temperatures.
