# GNR-SMU

Telemetry map and SMU control tools for AMD Granite Ridge (Zen 5) under Linux.

Telemetry and controls are supported on the Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D.
The 9950X3D profile includes all 16 per-core temperatures and a model-specific SMU
command allowlist; see [`docs/9950X3D.md`](docs/9950X3D.md).

On the 9950X3D, no PM-table block is currently established as live per-core
frequency. The GUI uses Linux `cpufreq` for that value and keeps the mapped PM
blocks labelled as Power, FIT, Activity, C0, CC1 and CC6 instead of guessing.

The `ryzen_smu` driver exposes a model-specific PM table at
`/sys/kernel/ryzen_smu_drv/pm_table`, with no published layout. The 9800X3D table is
1828 bytes / 457 float32 values; the 9950X3D table is 2452 bytes / 613 values. This
repo contains the measured layouts and tools that select the correct profile.

## Wanted: a dump from any other Granite Ridge part

This is the one thing that would move the project forward, and it takes about ten
seconds. Any still-unmapped Zen 5 desktop chip — 9600X, 9700X, 9900X, 9950X, or a
different PM-table version:

```bash
sudo python3 tools/dump_table_full.py > my_dump.txt
```

Open an issue with that file and your exact CPU model. The dump tool works on
unvalidated hardware on purpose: it drops the labels and prints raw values, which is
exactly what is needed to compare layouts.

Why it matters: the complete labelled map still comes from the 9800X3D. The 9950X3D
establishes how the 16-wide per-core arrays shift, but most of its remaining 613-float
table has not yet been identified.

The other open questions need a different lever rather than more data. Thirteen fields
have a narrowed domain but no identification, because under load every axis rises at
once and none of them separates cleanly; on Zen 5 the die's thermal constant is
sub-second, so decay timing cannot separate the power and thermal domains either. That
needs frequency varied at constant power, or fixed power at two ambient temperatures.
And there is no live EDC value anywhere in this table version — that one is closed, and
the search is written up as a negative result.

## Read this before running it on your machine

**The complete map was measured on exactly one machine:** a Ryzen 7 9800X3D,
8 cores / 1 CCD, PM table version `0x620105`. The 9950X3D has a separate 613-float
profile, and its 16-lane per-core temperature block was independently validated on
both CCDs. It does not claim that the complete 9800X3D map applies.

That matters more than it sounds, because the failure mode is silent. A different
table version moves offsets, but the bytes still parse as floats — so a GUI can show
plausible watts and degrees that are simply the wrong fields. A different core count
also changes the width and starting index of later per-core arrays.

So the tools check first ([`tools/hwgate.py`](tools/hwgate.py)) and refuse rather than
guess:

| | Validated hardware | Anything else |
|---|---|---|
| Telemetry display | profile-specific | stops, with the reason |
| CSV/JSON export | profile-specific | exits, does not write a file |
| SMU writes (limits, Curve Optimizer) | profile allowlist only | blocked |

If you hit the gate, send a dump rather than loosening it — the offsets would be wrong,
not missing.

## What is actually known

All 457 indices have a row in [PM_TABLE_MAP.md](PM_TABLE_MAP.md), but the rows carry
very different weight, and the confidence column says which is which:

- **Cross-validated (strongest).** 14 automated checks compare PM fields against
  independent sensors — `k10temp`, `amdgpu`, `cpufreq`, DDR5 nominal — or against
  stock spec. Tctl, per-core temperatures, per-core frequency, boost limit, Vcore,
  VDDCR_SoC, VDDIO_MEM, iGPU clock, C6 residency, and the PPT/TDC/EDC limits
  (162 W / 120 A / 180 A, exact) are in this group.
- **Structural.** Zone `0x000` is the classic Zen `(LIMIT, VALUE)` pair layout: PPT
  `0x008`/`0x00C` in watts, TDC `0x020`/`0x024` in amps, thermal `0x028`/`0x02C` in
  °C, EDC limit at `0x0FC`. Every real temperature in the table is direct °C — there
  is no encoding to undo.
- **Inferred.** Correlation and load response only. Treat as a hypothesis.
- **Known wrong, and left in the map as such.** Several fields once marked CONFIRMED
  were disproved; the rows now say what they are *not*. See
  [the honesty audit](PM_TABLE_MAP.md#honesty-audit-2026-07-30).

Open questions are tracked in [docs/TOFIX.md](docs/TOFIX.md); the EDC search is written
up as
[a negative result](PM_TABLE_MAP.md#edc_value--closed-negative-result-2026-07-30).

## Verifying the map

The map is not trusted on its word. [`research/audit_map.py`](research/audit_map.py)
parses `PM_TABLE_MAP.md` itself and asserts every mechanically checkable claim against
live hardware — static fields must not move under load, fields documented as zero must
read zero, documented mirrors must be bit-identical, and cross-validated fields must
match their system sensor within tolerance. It exits non-zero on any failure.

```bash
sudo python3 research/audit_map.py
```

It runs a stress load and takes a few minutes. Its first run found 11 genuine
documentation errors, including three "perfect mirrors" that differ on every read and
nine fields labelled energy accumulators that do not accumulate.

Two measurement lessons from building it are worth stealing if you write your own:

- **Read the external sensor before `pm_table`, not after.** The PM table read costs
  an SMU transfer that warms the die enough to show in the next sensor read — a
  +2.4 °C bias, larger than most things you would be validating.
- **Use medians over a window, and compare sensors sampled in the *same* window.**
  Occasional garbage sysfs reads wreck a mean, and a reading taken before or after the
  window is a different point on a thermal transient.
- **Wait for equilibrium, and prove it with two stable windows, not one.** A sensor
  disagreement of a few degrees is almost always cooldown, not calibration: after a
  stress load the `k10temp` − `d[11]` delta decays +7.3 → +1.0 °C over a couple of
  minutes and only then settles at +0.15 °C. Single instantaneous reads cannot tell
  that apart from noise — at idle `k10temp` alone swings 46.6 → 64.6 °C on background
  activity.

## Tools

All of them need the `ryzen_smu` driver loaded, and root.

```bash
sudo python3 tools/gui/gnr_master.py      # one-page PyQt6 dashboard: cores, rails, L3 candidates
sudo python3 tools/gnr_master.py          # menu-driven CLI for limits and Curve Optimizer
sudo python3 tools/export_telemetry.py    # 5 JSON snapshots
sudo python3 tools/export_telemetry.py --csv
sudo python3 tools/export_telemetry.py --live 2   # append a CSV row every 2 s
sudo python3 tools/export_telemetry.py --temps    # all per-core temperatures once
sudo python3 tools/dump_table_full.py      # complete table; labels where mapped
```

SMU control uses profile-specific MP1 mailbox **message IDs** (not table offsets).
On the 9800X3D the empirically mapped commands remain `0x3E` PPT, `0x3D` TDC,
`0x3C` EDC and `0x50`-`0x57` per-core CO. The 9950X3D profile uses the maintained
ZenStates-Core mapping: `0x3E` PPT, `0x3C` TDC, `0x3D` EDC and `0x35` per-core CO
with CCD/core selection encoded in the argument. Curve Optimizer is write-only, so
the tools cache applied offsets in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnr_master.json`.

`research/` holds the measurement scripts, one per question asked: `audit_map.py`
(the map's regression gate), `recheck_zone0.py` / `recheck_sweep.py` / `recheck_edc.py`
(the zone 0x000 correction), `hunt_edc.py` (the exhaustive EDC search),
`classify_unknown.py`, `profile_load.py`, `profile_demoted.py` and
`transient_demoted.py`. `smu_send.py` and `smu_advanced.py` are standalone MP1/RSMU
mailbox tools.

`dump_table_full.py` prints the whole table with each field's documented meaning and
confidence, read from `PM_TABLE_MAP.md` itself.

## Requirements

- Linux 6.10+
- The [`ryzen_smu`](https://github.com/amkillam/ryzen_smu) kernel module, loaded
- `python3-pyqt6` and `pyqtgraph`, for the GUI only

## Safety

Writing to the SMU mailbox can destabilise or damage hardware. Specifics that matter:

- **A wrong offset is worse than a missing one.** Reading the wrong field shows a
  wrong number; writing a limit *derived* from a wrong field pushes it into the SMU.
  That has already happened here once — the thermal limit (88 °C) was read as TDC and
  pre-filled the write dialog as 88 A. Hence the hardware gate.
- **Both front-ends block message IDs `0x03`-`0x0D` and `0x10`** outright, and that
  should stay. `0x58`-`0x5D` freeze MP1 on this part; do not probe them.
- Stock limits are 162 W PPT / 120 A TDC / 180 A EDC on the 9800X3D and 200 W /
  160 A / 225 A on the 9950X3D. The reset paths select the matching profile.
- 3D V-Cache runs under a tighter thermal ceiling than the rest of the die. The
  table reports 88 °C on the tested 9800X3D and 95 °C on the tested 9950X3D.
- SMU settings are volatile — a reboot reverts everything to BIOS constraints. That is
  also your recovery path.
