"""Dump the PM table, labelled from PM_TABLE_MAP.md.

Modes are chosen by the hardware profile rather than by a flag:

  full 9800X3D map     every float with its documented meaning and confidence level
  other profiles       complete raw table, plus any separately validated ranges

The labels used to live in a dict right here, which meant a third hand-maintained
copy of the map alongside the GUI and the exporter — and it drifted badly. By the
time it was noticed it still called d[3] "Package Temp", d[8] "EDC Limit" and d[10]
"TDC Limit", all three of which the zone 0x000 correction had already disproved, plus
a row of energy accumulators that do not accumulate. So it reads the map instead. One
source of truth, and a stale label is now impossible rather than merely unlikely.

The raw mode is the point of the unvalidated path: a dump from another Granite Ridge
part is the one thing that would let the map grow past this one machine, and refusing
to produce it would be refusing the contribution.
